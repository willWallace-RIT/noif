noif algorithm
spatial algorithm

uses the diagonal of a screen to create a box of a position and size using a proportional height and width in relation to the screen.
the code avoid if and uses mults,subtracts and bit shifting to detect overlap of the fairly approximated bounding box centered on the diagonal.

The algorithm recurses the usage of subs and shifting to create a OR gate with math operator only comparisons.

it currently supports two boxes but may support more using some customization.

(this is a 2D prototype. while 3D is possible it was not in my scope of open source support)
